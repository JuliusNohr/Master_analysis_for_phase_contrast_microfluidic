The code is the master script controling two other scripts Scaling_Analysis.ipynb and Growth_Rate_oscillation.ipynb.
Those scripts will be published later by Forshungzentrum JÃ¼lich.
The code is designed to run on a Jupiter Lab with Python ipkernel3. 

The purpose of this script is the controling of a pipeline analysing Phase contrast timelapse images from microfluidic research on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. 
It was designed working with an Omero server as data storage.
